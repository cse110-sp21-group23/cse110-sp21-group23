- I added the list structure onto the daily page, but it interacts with Delph / Index such that when a form is submitted, a new state is registered. I tried to fix it but had no luck. I'm going to move onto adding in the day pickeer onto the page.

### **Kent Utomo:** 

### **Michael Fu:**
- Worked on edit bullet, got it to edit the text + the type of bullet.
- Maybe I'll try to get it to edit picture / audio but not really high priority.
- My Liveserver wasn't updating my code, it took me an hour to realize I needed to clear my cookies (that was a pain).
