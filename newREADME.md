## Design

The full design documentation of our Bullet Journal Application is under **/specs** folder.

- We have five **architecture decision records (adr)**,  [ADRS](https://github.com/zvidmarb/cse110-w21-group23/tree/master/specs/adrs).

- You can find the pitch document using this [link](https://github.com/zvidmarb/cse110-w21-group23/blob/master/specs/pitch/Pomodoro%20Pitch.pdf). The pitch document contain the topics of risks and rabbit holes as well as a visual representation of what you are doing in the form of system diagrams and wireframes. Our pitch also have a statement of purpose as well as a section on user personas. 

- Our UI designer creates multiple version of the Bullet Journal Application, [check it out](https://github.com/zvidmarb/cse110-w21-group23/tree/master/specs/interface)!

- First version of design style guide is [here](https://github.com/zvidmarb/cse110-w21-group23/blob/master/specs/style/DesignGuidev1.pdf).

- We come up we two [user personas](https://github.com/zvidmarb/cse110-w21-group23/tree/master/specs/users) for who might using our Bullet Journal Application.

## Source 
[\source](https://github.com/zvidmarb/cse110-w21-group23/tree/master/source) folder includes all source code and test code of Bullet Journal Application.\
We separate the code in three part, css code in \css folder, java script code in \js folder, and the index.html is in the root of \source.

- Unit test
If you want to know more about the unit test, click [here](https://github.com/zvidmarb/cse110-w21-group23/tree/master/source/unitTests).


## Testing
We mainly focus on the unit tests, and have some cypress test for the part that we cannot use unit test to test. We spent a lot of time on how to run both unit test and cypress test together and have an integrated test coverage, but it does not allow us to do it, so we have separated test coverages.
- Unit test
  - We did most of testing on unit test, except the start/stop button. Below is the coverage of the unit test.\

- Cypress
  - We did start/stop button and other small test on cypress for e2e test as well (note that due to issues implementing a GitHub Action workflow and time restraints this was done by hand)
