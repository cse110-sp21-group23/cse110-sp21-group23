This article explains how to use and navigate through our bullet journal application.
## How to get started
Do one of the following to view the End-User Documentation content:

1. First, you can visit the website where our bullet journal is deployed [here](https://cse110-23-web.herokuapp.com/).
2. Once on the login page, you are able to sign up for an account by clicking on the sign up button and providing a valid email address along with a password for the account. Once signed in or registered, you will be directed to the home page, the daily view.

3. On the daily view page, you can use our entry creator to create new tasks, events, or notes on that day or click on the calendar to choose any calendar date you would like to input new events for. You can also access a weekly view of your bullet journal on the weekly view page. You can also double click any bullet to open up an entry editor.

4. On the weekly view page, you have all the same functionality as you do with the daily view page where you can feel free to create any new entries on any of the days shown. Additionally, you are able to drag and drop events between different dates in the case you would like to easily move entries to different dates. Like on the daily view page, the weekly view page has an editing function you can access by double clicking any bullet which will pop up an entry editor.
