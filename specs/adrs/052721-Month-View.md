# Implement a Month View for Bullets

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to implement a feature in which we can view the bullets associated for an entire month.

### Include a month view

* Good, because it gives us a new feature
* Bad, because adding an extra feature will increase complexity
* Bad, because there isn't very much meaning in seeing the bullet points of an entire month

### Do not Include a month view

* Good, because seeing the bullets for an entire month might not be helpful
* Bad, because it takes away a feature
