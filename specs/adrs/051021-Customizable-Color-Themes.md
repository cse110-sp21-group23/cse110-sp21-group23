# Customizable Color Themes for Website

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to implement a feature in which we can change the bullet journal to several themes of colors such as a light-mode version and a dark-mode version so that the user can choose their preference

### Include Color Customization

* Good, because it will allow the users to have better access 
* Bad because we do not understand how to implement this flexibility within the design elements of the website that allow it to be changed on the fly

### Do not include color customization

* Good, because it allots us less work to do and less prone to errors.
* Bad because our users cannot have good accessibility to different color themes if they dislike the main theme.=
