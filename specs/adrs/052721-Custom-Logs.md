# Implement a Custom Log for Categories such as Food, Health, Habit, etc.

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to implement a custom log feature in which the user can log things important to them, such as the foods that they've eaten, the exercise they have performed, or their habits throughout the day.

### Include a custom log

* Good, because it gives us a new feature
* Good, because it allows the user to build an experience tailored more towards them
* Bad, because adding an extra feature will increase complexity
* Bad, because it can be ambigous to define or design

### Do not Include a custom log

* Good, because the complexity and ambiguity would make the feature difficult to produce
* Bad, because it takes away a feature
* Bad, because it takes customization away from the user
