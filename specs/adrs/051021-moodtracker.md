# Implementing a Mood Tracker

## Context and Problem Statement

We want to implement more features into our project, but a mood tracker seems difficult to pull off.

## Considered options
### Include a mood tracker

* Good, because it gives us a novel component to our mood tracker.
* Bad because it's not really so novel in relation to the other groups, because it seems like everybody is implementing a mood tracker. 
* Bad because we now have to make an entirely new page and adopt a lot of outside code because two members who were responsible for it have done none of it. 

### Do not include a Mood Tracker

* Good, because the simplicity of the bullet journal may be appealing. 
* Good because it'll save the sanity of the 7 members who are actually working on the project. 
* Bad because it takes away the one "novel" component of our bulet journal. 

## Decision Outcome 
Chosen option: "Include the mood tracker" because, 
* Despite everybody implementing the mood tracker, without it, our bullet journal has no special features which is a graded category in the rubric. 
* From a consumer standpoint, the bullet journal without the mood tracker is essentially a "notes" app with some categorization by dates.
